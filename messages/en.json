    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Quick answers to help you understand and start with Solana Game",
    "q1": "What is Solana Game and how does it work?",
    "a1": "Solana Game is a decentralized matrix platform running entirely on Solana smart contracts. When you activate a level, you join a global queue. As new players activate the same level after you, they fill your 3 slots. Once all 3 slots are filled, you receive payouts and automatically re-enter the queue. This cycle repeats indefinitely — one activation gives you unlimited earning potential.",
    "q2": "How many levels are there and what do they cost?",
    "a2": "There are 16 levels with fixed prices in SOL: L1 = 0.05, L2 = 0.18, L3 = 0.36, L4 = 0.68, L5 = 1.1, L6 = 1.55, L7 = 2.1, L8 = 2.65, L9 = 3.25, L10 = 3.9, L11 = 4.65, L12 = 5.45, L13 = 6.4, L14 = 7.35, L15 = 8.0, L16 = 8.7 SOL. Each level operates independently with its own queue — you can activate any level in any order.",
    "q3": "How much do I earn and where does the money go?",
    "a3": "When someone activates a level, payments are distributed instantly: 60% goes to the queue leader (level owner), 13% to their 1st line referrer, 8% to 2nd line, 5% to 3rd line, and 14% to platform treasury. Per cycle (3 slots filled), you receive 180% of the level price. All transfers happen atomically in one blockchain transaction.",
    "q4": "How does the referral program work?",
    "a4": "When you register, your referral chain is recorded on-chain (3 levels deep). Your referrers earn 13%, 8%, and 5% from each of your level activations. Important: referral bonuses only apply if your upline has the same level active. If not, their share goes to treasury. This incentivizes everyone to activate more levels.",
    "q5": "What happens after my 3 slots are filled?",
    "a5": "Your level automatically 'recycles' — your slots reset to 0, your cycle counter increases by 1, and you re-enter the queue at the end. You keep your position and continue earning from the same level activation forever. There is no limit to how many cycles you can complete.",
    "q6": "How do I get started?",
    "a6": "Step 1: Connect your Phantom wallet (or another Solana wallet). Step 2: Register your player profile — this creates your on-chain account and records your referrer. Step 3: Activate Level 1 for 0.05 SOL. Step 4: Share your referral link to earn bonuses when others join. You can monitor your slots, cycles, and earnings in real-time on your dashboard.",
    "q7": "Is my money safe? Can anyone steal my funds?",
    "a7": "Your funds are completely safe. The platform runs on verified, immutable smart contracts — no one (including developers) can modify the code or access your wallet. Payments go directly wallet-to-wallet without any intermediaries. The contract includes TxGuard protection against duplicate transactions. You never give custody of your funds to anyone.",
    "q8": "What if no one activates after me?",
    "a8": "Your position in the queue is permanent and never expires. You simply wait until new players activate the level. The queue is global — all players worldwide share the same queue for each level. The more popular the level, the faster your slots fill. Higher levels may take longer but offer larger payouts."

It operates through verified smart contracts with no central control, meaning no one can modify the rules or access your funds.\n\nThe platform uses an X3 matrix model where each level has a global queue. When you activate a level, you enter the queue. As new players activate the same level, they fill your slots (3 slots per cycle). Once all slots are filled, you receive payouts and automatically re-enter the queue for unlimited cycles."
